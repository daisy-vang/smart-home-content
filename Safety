        <h3>Water:Ceiling Walls</h3>
        <img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" width="500" height="600">
        <p>Water ceiling walls in a smart home serve as a safety protocol designed to protect against water damage and flooding. Here's how they work: Detection: Sensors embedded in the ceiling walls detect leaks or water intrusion early, identifying potential problems before they cause significant damage. Automatic Response: Upon detecting a leak, the system can automatically shut off the main water supply to prevent further flooding. Alerts: The system sends notifications to your smartphone or smart devices, alerting you to the issue and providing real-time updates on the situation. Integration: It can be connected with other smart home systems, such as activating water shut-off valves, turning off electricity in affected areas to prevent electrical hazards, or sending alerts to emergency contacts. Monitoring and Control: Through a smartphone app or smart home hub, you can monitor the status of the water ceiling walls, receive maintenance reminders, and check for any issues remotely. Proactive Maintenance: Some systems can perform self-diagnoses and alert you to potential issues before they become serious problems. Overall, water ceiling walls enhance safety by preventing water damage and providing quick responses to leaks, integrating seamlessly with your smart home ecosystem for comprehensive protection.</p>

        <h3>Water Rats</h3>
        <img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" width="500" height="600">
        <p>In a smart home, "water rats" refer to specialized smart devices designed to assist with fire suppression by using water. Here’s how they work: Detection: These devices are equipped with sensors to detect the presence of fire or extreme heat. They can often integrate with smoke alarms or fire detection systems for more accurate and timely response. Activation: Upon detecting a fire, the water rats automatically activate and release a controlled spray or mist of water. This helps to suppress or extinguish the flames effectively.
            Integration: They work in conjunction with other smart home systems, such as triggering smart fire alarms or notifying emergency services, to coordinate a comprehensive response.
            Remote Monitoring: Through a smartphone app or smart home hub, you can monitor the status of the water rats, check for any issues, and receive alerts if they are activated.
            Automated Response: In addition to extinguishing fires, these devices might also work with other smart systems to turn on lights, unlock doors, or manage other safety features to help with evacuation.
            Overall, water rats in a smart home provide an advanced, automated approach to fire suppression, integrating with the home's overall safety system to enhance fire response and protection.</p>
